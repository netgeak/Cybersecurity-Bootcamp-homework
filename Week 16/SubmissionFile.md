## Week 16 Homework

#### Step 1: Google Dorking


- Using Google, can you identify who the Chief Executive Officer of Altoro Mutual is:

Karl Fitzgerald

- How can this information be helpful to an attacker:
   * An attacker can use his name to deduce possible email addresses he has and his login ID. 
      - Using the potential email addresses, the attacker can launch whale-phishing attacks.
      - Using the potential login IDs, the attacker can try to crack his password.
   * The attacker can research the CEO's public interests and can use this information:
      - in phishing email attacks
      - to create dictionaries of words to brute force crack his password
   * The attacker can perform social engineering attacks against other employees using tactics such as authority, intimidation and urgency.

#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: 

    * City: Sunnyvale
    * State/Province: CA (California)
    * Postal Code: 94085
    * Country: US

  2. What is the NetRange IP address:

65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure:

Rackspace Backbone Engineering

  4. What is the IP address of the DNS server:

65.61.137.117

#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find:

Shodan only found three open ports and services:
* 80: Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine1.1
* 443: Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine1.1
* 8080: Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine1.1


#### Step 4: Recon-ng

- Install the Recon module `xssed`. 
- Set the source to `demo.testfire.net`. 
- Run the module. 

Is Altoro Mutual vulnerable to XSS: Yes.


### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 
 
 nmap -sV 192.168.0.10
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:

nmap -oN zenmapscan.txt -sV 192.168.0.10

[zenmapscan.txt](zenmapscan.txt)

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 

nmap --script samba-vuln-cve-2012-1182 192.168.0.10

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:

  1. What is the vulnerability:
  
    * https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-1182/
    * https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/samba-vuln-cve-2012-1182.html

  2. Why is it dangerous:

    * Samba versions 3.6.3 and all versions previous to this are affected by a vulnerability that allows remote code execution as the "root" user from an anonymous connection.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:

    This vulnerability has an exceptionally high CVSS score of 10 because the attacker exploiting this vulnerability can grant the attacker root access and the attack can be executed over the Internet. Before executing any mitigration strategies, it's important to find out if the Metasploitable machine is exposed to the general public and what files are being shared.
    
    If Metasploitable is exposed to the general public, we need to resort to immediate action:
    * disable the Samba service until an upgrade can be performed.
    * schedule an upgrade to a version of Samba that is after 3.6.3
   
   If Metasploitable is not meant to be exposed to the general public, we should find out what the staff members are sharing on it.
   
   If staff members are just storing their favourite lolcat memes and pirated TV episodes:
   * it is not that urgent that we correct the situation
   * we need try to deter and prevent staff members from putting sensitive data on it by informing them not to do do that (eg via email)
   * we may need to monitor the server to ensure that no sensitive data is being put on the server
   * we should try to ensure that the firewall keeps Metasploitable behind it so no outside attackers get a foothold within our Intranet
   * (maybe we should shut down the Samba service if people are storing illegal downloads on it and if we're concerned we'll get audited)
   
   If staff members are storing sensitive data on Metasploitable, we should be concerned about internal threats and:
    * temporarily disable the Samba service until an upgrade can be performed.
    * schedule an upgrade to a version of Samba that is after 3.6.3
