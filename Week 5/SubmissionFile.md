Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt.

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: tar xvvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory: tar cvvWf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude='TarDocs/Documents/Java' TarDocs

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive: tar tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory: tar cvvWf logs_backup_tar.gz --listed-incremental=snapshot.file --level=0 /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
- -c is for create and -x is for extract. They would work against eachother.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:

crontab -e

0 6 * * 3 tar czvf ~/auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log/
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    [Your logrotate scheme edits here]
    ```
3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable: chmod +x system.sh

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    [Your logrotate scheme edits here]
    ```
---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations
**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:  sudo ./system.sh

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory: sudo mv system.sh /etc/cron.weekly/system

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    [Your logrotate scheme edits here]
    ```
---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active: sudo systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size: sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    # see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
su root syslog

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# no packages own wtmp, or btmp -- we'll rotate them here
/var/log/wtmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0664 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

/var/log/btmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0660 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

# system-specific logs may be configured here
notifyempty

compress


3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:

sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules


   ## First rule - delete all
-D

## Increase the buffers to survive stress events.
## Make this bigger for busy systems
-b 8192

## This determine how long to wait in burst of events
--backlog_wait_time 0

## Set failure mode to syslog
-f 1

-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k shadow
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd
-w /var/log/auth.log -p wa -k auth


4. Command to restart `auditd`:sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules: ls -lat /etc/logrotate.d

6. Command to produce an audit report: sudo aureport -au

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules: auditctl -l

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```
